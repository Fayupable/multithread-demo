# Multithread Demo Application

A Spring Boot application designed to demonstrate multithreaded task management. This project serves as a practical implementation for testing asynchronous operations and multithreaded programming, enhancing performance and scalability.

## Key Features

- **Asynchronous Task Handling**: Utilizes `CompletableFuture` to manage tasks asynchronously and efficiently.
- **Spring Boot Integration**: Seamless integration with Spring Boot JPA for database operations.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Configurable task executors to handle multiple concurrent tasks effectively.

## Prerequisites

- Java: Version 17 or later
- Maven: Version 3.8 or later
- MySQL Database

## Project Configuration

### application.properties

Define the following configurations in your `application.properties` file:

```properties
# Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

# Task Executor Configuration
spring.task.execution.pool.core-size=10
spring.task.execution.pool.max-size=50
spring.task.execution.pool.queue-capacity=100
spring.task.execution.thread-name-prefix=taskExecutor-
```

## Usage Examples

### Adding a Task

- **Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8080/api/tasks/add`
- **HTTP Method**: POST
- **Request Body**:

```json
{
  "title": "New Task",
  "description": "Description of the new task",
  "startDate": "2023-10-01T10:00:00",
  "endDate": "2023-10-02T18:00:00",
  "personId": 1
}
```

### Adding a Person

- **Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8080/person/create`
- **HTTP Method**: POST
- **Request Body**:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

### Entity ID Assignment

Entities in the project are automatically assigned unique IDs using a Snowflake ID generator.

Example:

```java
@Entity
public class Task {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @PrePersist
    public void prePersist() {
        SnowflakeUtil.prePersist(this);
    }
}
```

## Key Implementation Details

1. **Asynchronous Operations**:
    - The project uses `CompletableFuture` to handle tasks asynchronously.
    - Tasks are executed in a custom-configured thread pool.
2. **Configurable Task Executor**:
    - Core and maximum thread pool sizes, along with queue capacity, can be configured in `application.properties`.
3. **Database Integration**:
    - Fully integrated with Spring Data JPA for seamless database interactions.

## Performance Considerations

- **Concurrent Execution**: Tasks are executed concurrently, leveraging the multithreaded executor.
- **Low Overhead**: Optimized for efficient task handling.
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Ensures minimal synchronization contention.

## Best Practices

- Use unique identifiers for entities.
- Implement error handling in all asynchronous operations.
- Monitor thread pool utilization to ensure optimal performance.
- Test concurrency scenarios under realistic loads.

## Potential Improvements

- **Distributed Task Management**: Integrate with distributed systems like RabbitMQ or Kafka.
- **Fallback Strategies**: Add retry mechanisms for failed tasks.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Create unit and integration tests for all major workflows.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute:
1. Add new features like advanced error handling or monitoring.
2. Ensure consistency in thread-safe operations.
3. Submit detailed test cases for multithreaded workflows.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Fayupable/multithread-demo.git
```

2. Update the `application.properties` file with your database credentials.
3. Build the project:
